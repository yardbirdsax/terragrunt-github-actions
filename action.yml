  tf_actions_pre_commands:

      An arbitrary series of commands to execute before running the specified command.
      This can be used to customize the Docker execution environment. If any of these commands
      need to set environment variables required at the time `terragrunt` is executed, you must
      add them to the file at the path defined by the `ENV_VAR_FILE` environment variable as a
      key/value pair, like this:

      ```
      echo "FOO=bar" >> ${ENV_VAR_FILE}
      ```
    default: ''
    required: false
  download_retry_attempts:
    description: >
      Sets the maximum number of times the Action will retry downloading various components. This
      is a PER DOWNLOAD counter; for example, if the Action encounters issues querying for the
      a version of Terragrunt such that it retries 5 times before succeeding, those retries
      are not included in subsequent download attempts.
    default: "5"
    required: false
  download_max_time:
    description: >
      The maximum time (in seconds) the Action will retry when downloading various components.
      Just as with 'download_retry_attempts', this is a PER DOWNLOAD timer.
